# Hello World of ML: Working with Iris dataset

My first project in ML world was working with Iris dataset, when I was pursuing MS Data Science (Spring: 2016-2018). The Iris flower dataset is a basic example for demonstrating classification problems, it is used as the “hello world” dataset in machine learning and statistics by pretty much everyone.

## Steps in Building Classification model to classify Iris flowers

1. Installing libraries
2. Loading the dataset
3. Exploratory analysis:
    a. Summarizing the dataset
    b. Data Visualization
4. Model Building
    a. Create validation dataset
    b. Classification algorithms:
        i. Logistic Regression
        ii. Linear Discriminant Analysis
        iii. K-Nearest Neighbors
        iv. Classification and Regression Trees
        v. Gaussian Naive Bayes
        vi. Support Vector Machines
5. Make Predictions
